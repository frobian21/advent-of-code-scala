# 2024 - Uiua
I'll be doing [advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in [uiua](https://www.uiua.org/).
The solutions are written in [uiua pad](https://www.uiua.org/pad) on my phone and then sent to my desktop where the real inputs run faster. Also text formatting is easier on the PC.
To this end, I'll be writing the solutions against the bleeding edge of the releases, `v0.14.0-dev.7` at the time of writing.
- `rustup update stable`
- `cargo install uiua` or `cargo install --git https://github.com/uiua-lang/uiua uiua` for the bleeding edge.
- `uiua init`
- `uiua test` will run the tests
- `uiua run 2024/day1.ua`
